# hello-world
This repository is to test and learn GitHub. This is created in Week 3 of Semester 2 Year 2 of my Degree while in a class that I should probably pay attention to ::))

This is the first change of edits for this file, I am just following whatever the guide is saying, the lecture is about some hardware stuff. I am "looking forward" to apply OOP and Data Stuctures and Algorithms in CðŸ¤¯.
